TWPS: (T)ext (W)ith (P)ython (S)nippets
==========================================

A python package to preprocess text files with embedded Python code snippets:
evaluate or execute them and replace with the result of evaluation/execution.

This package provides the ``ppp.py`` script. The script reads the file
specified in the command line, finds python snippets, evaluates or executes
them and writes out the file with the pyhton code replaced with the
evaluateion/execution result. 

For command line options see ``readme.rst`` in the ``twps`` folder or run the
script without command line arguemnt. 

General description with examples (somewhat outdated) can be found in the
``docs`` folder.

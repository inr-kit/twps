TWPS: (T)ext (W)ith (P)ython (S)nippets
==========================================

A python package to preprocess text files with embedded Python code snippets:
evaluate or execute them and replace with the result of evaluation/execution.

Currently, the only up-to-date description of the command line arguments can be
found in the source code `twps/ppp.py`_ or by calling the ``ppp.py`` script
with the ``--help`` command line argument (or without any arguments). The
description_ found in the ``docs`` folder still describes correctly the main
idea and the syntax of the template file, but not the command line arguments. 

.. _`twps/ppp.py`: twps/ppp.py
.. _description: docs/build/latex/twps.pdf


Folder `docs`_ contains sources for documentation, written in 2013. It cannot
be compiled as is with the current version of Sphinx/rst2pdf. Result of
compilation into HTML will be added later.

.. _docs: ./docs

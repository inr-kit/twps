TSP: (T)ext with (S)nippets (P)reprocessor
==========================================

A python package to preprocess text files with embedded code snippets: evaluate
or execute them and replace with the result of evaluation/execution.

Currently, the only up-to-date description of the command line arguments can be found in the source code `tsp/ppp.py`_ or by calling the ``ppp.py`` script with the ``--help`` command line argument (or without any arguments). The description_ found in the ``docs`` folder still describes correctly the main idea and the syntax of the template file, but not the command line arguments. 

.. _`tsp/ppp.py`: tsp/ppp.py
.. _description: docs/build/latex/tsp.pdf


Folder `docs`_ contains sources for documentation, written in 2013. It cannot
be compiled as is with the current version of Sphinx/rst2pdf. Result of
compilation into HTML will be added later.

.. _docs: ./docs

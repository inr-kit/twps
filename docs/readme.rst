INR report written with the help of Shpinx
===========================================

Documentation written in Sphinx can be translated into several formats, among
them latex.  Description for the TSP package is an example of how to modify the
latex files generated by Sphinx to fulfill formatting requirements of KIT
internal reports.

Examples of writing slides in Latex with KIT formatting can be found in ``pirs/docs/talks/``.

Recipe 
------- 

This recipe describes only steps to apply KIT report formatting
to the latex files generated by Sphinx.


Install latex styles for KIT reports [#]_. Copy file ``source/sphinxkit.sty``
to the directory ``$texmflocal/tex/latex/KIT/``. Then, update sl-R file by the
command ``mktexlsr`` issued in ``$texmflocal``.

Write a preamble containing information about autor, abstract, report number
(example is ``source/preamble.tex``), and specify that this preamble should be
included into the latex file by modifying the ``latex_elements`` variable in
the configuration file ``source/conf.py``. 

References should be included using the latex command ``\cite``. Correspondent
style file and bibliography files should be in ``source/_static/`` folder, and
in the configuration file should be specified, that these files are copied to the 
folder where the latex file is generated (see variable ``latex_additional_files`` in
``source/conf.py``).

To generate the latex file and to process it, use script ``make_pdf.sh``.  It
starts Sphinx to generate the latex file, performs some modifications to the
generated latex file, and, finally, starts the latex and bibtex engines to
generate pdf file. The modifications to the latex file generated by Sphinx  are
still necessary to comply with the KIT latex styles.

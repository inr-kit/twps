$ ppp.py

(P)ython (P)re(P)rocessor: script from the tsp Python package. Abbreviation
"tsp" means (T)ext with (S)nippets (P)reprocessor.

Usage:

> ppp.py [-'snippet'] [--'var list_of_values'] template

where `template' is a text file containing python snippets.  Snippets are
evaluated/executed and the snippet code is replaced with the result of
evaluation/execution. The resulting file is saved to `template.res'.

Optional argument starting with single `-` is a snippet evaluated before
processing the template. Thus, one can e.g. define in the command line a
parameter used later in the template.

Optional argument(s) starting with two minus signs, `--`, define variables for
parametric studies. The string following `--` (possibly protected with single
or double quotes) defines the name of the variable and the list of values this
variable takes. The template is processed for each variable's value; the
resulting file is written to `template._i1_i2_..._iN`, where i1 is the index of
the 1-st variable's value, i2 -- the index of the second variable's value etc.

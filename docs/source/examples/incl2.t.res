Example of including another template.
File "itempl.txt" is first preprocessed
and its result is inserted here:

    Included templates can have 
    their own delimiters.
	
    For better representation, the 
    lines of the included template 
    are indented.

    Varible A is defined here:
    /A=5/.

Note that variable A defined in the 
included template is available here:
A = 5.

"""
The module defines function :func:`pre_pro`, which evaluates or executes python
snippets inside a text file, and replace snippet code with the
evaluation/execution result.

See detailed description in 'doc' directory of the source distribution.

.. todo::


    * Indentation:

     Optional parameter to prepro to indent all resulting text. (Thus,
     indentation will be defined in the parent template, not in the child
     template)


    * Sequence of values for parametric studies

     Command line parameter specifying a seequence of input parameters.
     Generates several resulting files. Possible command line syntax:

        --ParameterName "python expression for sequence"

     i.e one can specify arbitrary variable name. If several ranges are given,
     the number of resulting files is N1 x N2 x ... Nm, where Ni -- number of
     values for i-th variable.

        --a "range(10)" --b "np.arange(0.01, 0.05, 10)"

    Preprocess template file fname.

    :arg fname:

        String, name of the template file to be processed.

    :arg level:

        level is necessary to distinguish the top-level template from templates
        called from withing the top or above templates. Only for the top-level
        template (which has level not equal to 'default') all resulting strings
        are written to resulting file.

    :arg preamb:

        A string representing the snippet to be evaluated/executed before
        snippets in the file. This is to allow snippets in the command line.

    :arg clp:

        A list of (name, vals) tuples, defining parameters for parametric
        studies.

    :arg kwargs:

        All other keyword arguments are valiable names and their set of values.
        Similar to ``clp``, but the order cannot be guarantied.

    ``fname`` is a text file with python snippets. The function evaluates or
    executes snippets and replace the snippet code with the evaluation or
    execution result.

    If ``level`` is equal to ``default``, ther resulting text is returned as a
    list of strings. Otherwise, the resulting text will be written to file with
    the name ``fname + '.res'``, and the modification time of the resulting
    file will set to the modification time of the template.

    Before writing the resulting file, its modification time is compared with
    the modification time of the template. If the template is older (i.e. the
    resulting file was changed after it was generated with ``pre_pro``), the
    resulting file name will be prefixed with current date and time. Thus,
    changes introduced into resulting file (for example when a user accidentaly
    edits the resulting file instead of template) will not get lost.

    The template's first line must contain the two characters, used to denote
    the beginning and the end of snippets. Optionnaly, one can specify also in
    the first line the commenting string and snippet default key.

            # (which should be chosen to get the most relevantvim syntax
            # highlighting scheme) and optionally change the basename. For
            # example, for the result of preprocessing template
            # ``model.serp`` is ``model.r.serp`` or ``model.rN.serp``,
